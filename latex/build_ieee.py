"""Build the IEEE two-column version of this paper.

Run it after build.py, from the latex/ directory:

    python3 build.py ../results        # writes main.tex
    python3 build_ieee.py              # writes ieee/main_ieee.tex

to_ieee.py rewrites the journal-source manuscript into IEEEtran: it drops the
CRediT section (IEEE has no such field), lifts the funding statement into a
page-one \\thanks, rebuilds the author block in IEEE form, and widens only the
tables that overflow a column. The keyword list and the author-block variant
below are the ones used for the submitted version and are not inferred.
